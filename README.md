## Multimodal-Sentiment-Analysis
Emotions are subjective on the lines of culture, gender, language, and even down to the person, therefore, difficult to universally classify human sentiment.
Sentiment analysis has numerous impacts on different areas. As an example, sentiment analysis may be a powerful marketing tool that allows product managers to grasp customer emotions in their marketing campaigns. It is a vital factor when it involves product and brand recognition, customer loyalty, customer satisfaction, advertising and promotion success, and merchandise acceptance. 
Sometimes the meaning of what people say can be changed by what they say on their faces, and sometimes it could change by their speech tones.
This project aims to develop a model for both audio recordings and visual gestures to predict the sentiment behind a personâ€™s sentence. The intuition was that combining two models with two different sources, using multimodal learning, could improve the performance.
My mission is the create a multimodal network by machine learning which is using both audio and visual expressions of people by predicting their emotions.
In the end, I achieved 70% test accuracy using with both audio and visual SAVEE dataset.
